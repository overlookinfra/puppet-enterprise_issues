# Public Puppet Enterprise Issue Reporting

This repository will allow public community members to file bug reports, doc change
requests, and feature request against Puppet Enterprise and its components, such as
the PE management modules. If you're filing an issue on an open source project such
as Puppet or Facter, please use those repositories directly.

The PE Product team regularly monitors and triages issues and requests here. Planning
and roadmap activity takes place internally, so you may not see much activity until
engineering begins actively working on a reported issue.

:bulb: Note that there are no SLA agreements for issues filed in this way and customer
reports take priority. If you have a support contract, you should raise issues via
[support request](https://support.puppet.com/) to get them resolved expediently.

:bulb: Note: As this is a public repo, please avoid including any confidential or sensitive information in issues filed.

## Filing issues

1. Use the [`Issues`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/cem_issues/issues) tab above to get started
1. Search through the existing queue to see if your concern has already been reported. 
    * If it has been, then comment with any additional information or react with a üëç
      to add your support. You‚Äôll get any future notifications of activity on that ticket.
    * If not, then file your own issue, following the issue template to include as much
      helpful detail as you can.

Thank you so much for helping us improve our products!
